            <p>Space depends on ascii characters and 
                it’s completely build on top of that principle, 
                each space can get your value incremented by one.

                <br>
                Space doesn’t have that many built in
                symbols making it easy for users to remember the syntax.  
                It works on the principle that you can have multiple ways 
                to print an alphabet on screen but what makes it challenging 
                is to find a solution that doesn’t use much of “space”

                Each space (" ") and ^ symbol can increment and decrement value by one. 
                "/" symbol starts a loop and "\" symbol  ends a loop.
                "{" is used for left shift and "}" is used for right shift.
                "_" symbol will print the corresponding ascii value into
                the console

            Null is a very basic programming language. 
            One can find almost all the basic built-in
            functions like any other languages. 
            It's so basic that it doesn't have any 
            external libraries at the moment. 
            The language is in its primary phase 
            but also stable enough to program anything
            with it

            Programming world is filled with many
            languages coming out every day offering many 
            new functionalities but most of them tend to forget
            the fact that all these language bloated with 
            keywords are not helping beginners who just want 
            to get started 
                
        <br>

            That’s where NULL comes into play, Null is simple and basic
            programming language that gives you a syntactic idea about 
            how most of the languages work and wont overwhelm you with 
            tons of functions that you're probably not going to use in 
            your life
